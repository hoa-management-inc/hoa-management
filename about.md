# About Us
Three years ago, after a Homeowner Association board meeting and frustrated about the shortcomings of our third management
company, we looked at one another and said, "**We** could do a better job." Our experience as board members taught us
what it would take to build an effective management company. So, we resigned as board members, and starte HOA Management, Inc.

Our intent is to offer individualized, personal service. When you call, one of us will answer, or your call will be 
returned as soon as possible. You will always receive prompt, courteous attention. It is our priority to establish and
maintain professional relationships with all of our clients and their communities.

We tailor our services to meet your specific needs and provide reports that are meaningful to you. Monthly or quarterly
meetings will be scheduled to fit _your_ time constraints. We have been able to schedule meetings at a location that is
free of charge to the HOA. Because we sat where you are sitting, as board members for a Homeowners Association, and we have
a desire to help run your association smoothly and effectively. We are a good fit for your management needs.
